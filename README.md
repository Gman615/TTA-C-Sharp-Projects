# Car Insurance
This uses the MVC framework to create a mock website for a car insurance company. It feature business logic that uses user inputs to calculate an autoinsurance quote based general factors that would influence the price of autoinsurance. The project also includes an Admin page which shows the data entered on the website by various users.

# Package Express
This project is a basic console app that uses some business logic to calculate the price and shipping of packages with certain weight and dimensions.

# Enums
Enums shows practice executing Enums in C# with a console app.

# StructPractice
Just like the name, this is a console app in C# where I executed structs.

# EmployeeOverload
This project is a C# console app that shows overloading the == operator.

# DatePract
This is a C# project that shows use of date time. It is a console app that requests the user input a number, and then it calulates the date and time it will be after the user's number in hours.

# ConsoleApp
This is a C# console app project that shows some use of arrays, lists, and if/else logic. It also uses for and foreach loops to iterate through the arrays and lists to write certain bits of information to the console.
